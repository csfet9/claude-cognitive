## Agent Orchestration

You are the **orchestrator**. Delegate complex tasks to specialized agents using the Task tool.

### Built-in Agents

| Agent            | When to Use                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code-explorer`  | Before implementing features - explore codebase patterns, trace execution paths |
| `code-architect` | Before complex changes - design solutions, create implementation plans          |
| `code-reviewer`  | After writing code - review for bugs, security issues, adherence to patterns    |

### Orchestration Workflow

For non-trivial features, follow this workflow:

1. **Explore**: Launch `code-explorer` agents to understand existing patterns
2. **Clarify**: Ask user questions about unclear requirements
3. **Design**: Launch `code-architect` agents to create implementation plans
4. **Implement**: Write code following the chosen architecture
5. **Review**: Launch `code-reviewer` agents to check your work

**Parallelization**: Launch multiple agents with different focuses simultaneously.
**Memory**: Only YOU (orchestrator) access memory - agents receive context from you.
